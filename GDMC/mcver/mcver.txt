MCVER.TXT

This folder contains MC specific data files according to the game version.

Changes are happening in the game data, and we need to catch them outside the code itself.

Ech subfolder is named according to a version, and contains JSon files:

* blocks.json
* entities.json
* tileentities.json
* items.json

It is not necessary to have a folder for each version of the game. Only the ones which introduce changes has to be present.
All the same for the files, if changes occur only in blocks, the other files are useless.

Each entry is composed like this:

```
    {
        "id": 1,
        "idStr": "item",
        "_name": "item",
        "name": "Dropped item",
        "type": "Drops",
        "mapcolor": [34, 255, 34, 95]
    },
```

Where "id" is a numeric ID, "idStr" is a named ID (typically the 'minecraft:XXX' part after the colon).
Any MCEdit useful data can be added.
The "_name" sub-entry must be used to define the name of the object used internaly by MCEdit.
For recent game version this "_name" has the same value as "idStr", but for older systems, where these "idStr" aren't the same (or does not exists),
this "_name" value will be used by MCEdit to render and act correctly the objects.

Technically, MCEdit loads the files and search for the "_name". If not found, it will try to use the "idStr", and finally, fall back to the "id".
