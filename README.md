# Project
Repo for my final year MEng project. Using generative design in Minecraft to create settlements

## Environments

I am using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage different python installs and project dependencies. This project has its own enivronemnt running Python 2.7.15. To create a new environment:

`pyenv virtualenv 2.7.15 <env_name>`

To enter the environemnt:

`pyenv activate <env_name>`

Install required python packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Leave the environmnet:

`pyenv deactivate`
