Create Agents
While Simulating:
    Agent moves towards the next 'most interesting space':
        Observe surrounding blocks
        Mark cells near trees and water as more interesting
        Somehow label interesting building plots

For each plot
    Determine the building (House, farm, lighthouse, blacksmith.. etc)
    Generate building
    
Build paths connecting buildings
