Create Agents
While Simulating:
    Agent moves towards the next 'most interesting space':
        Observe surrounding blocks
        Mark cells near trees and water as more interesting
        Somehow label interesting building plots (flat space, nearby resources, near to water)

For each plot
    Determine the building (House, farm, lighthouse, blacksmith.. etc)
    Agents build:
        collect resources (cut down trees, stone etc)
        place blocks
    
Build paths connecting buildings
