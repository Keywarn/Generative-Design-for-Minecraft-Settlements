Create Agents
While Simulating:
    current = closest (also measure of interest) unobserved block in openList
    Agent moves towards current:
        For each surrounding block
            distance = distance to current block + 1
            if water: distance -= 1
            if tree: distance -= 2
            if block is accessible (not too high/low not in water):
                if block is in openList and distance <= current distance:
                    update distance
                if not in openList:
                    add surrounding block to openList
            
        Somehow label interesting building plots (flat space, nearby resources, near to water)

For each plot
    Determine the building (House, farm, lighthouse, blacksmith.. etc)
    Agents build:
        collect resources (cut down trees, stone etc)
        place blocks
    
Build paths connecting buildings
